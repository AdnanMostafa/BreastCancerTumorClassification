# BreastCancerTumorClassification
1. This project uses Machine Learning Techniques to classify tumors as either Malignant or Benign with 97% accuracy.
2. This technique can rapidly evaluate breast masses and classify them in automated fashion.
3. I used a dataset from UCI which had 569 instances of tumors: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29
4. The missclassification in this case study was of a Type 1 Error. In other words, 3 tumors were classified as Malignant when they were Benign.
5. There were no Type 2 Errors, which are far more dangerous. This would mean tumors would be classified as Benign while they are Malignant.
6. The technique can reduce workload for doctors and save lives, especially in the developing world.
7. The technique can be further improved by combining Computer vision/ML techniques to directly classify cancer using the tissue image.
